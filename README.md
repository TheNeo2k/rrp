### FiveM? Where Gone?

```markdown
Fivem was a massive undertaking, with months of development, attempted over multiple years, we finally released our first iteration of Fivem in November. It started well, peaking at 64 players in 12 minutes, then issues flared up and then over the weeks more and more bugs reared their ugly faces as a previous developer turned tail and fled. We closed down, rebuilt, changed the economy, tested, and started back up in February… once again off to an amazing start, week on week growing our player base, but then there were Hackers (Modders), Poor RP from established groups (IGB included), and it was basically an ArmA server in a FiveM world. Some bad decisions were made, and CFX was broken week after week preventing our peak times being populated and that was the final nail in the coffin.
We’ve closed the Doors to FiveM once more.
The future holds no guarantee’s, we are looking forwards to both GTA VI and ArmA IV, and who knows what else is out there. 
Neo & Fuel

Please note: The Arma server remains unaffected.```
